## NBA Parlay Model Project

This project is designed to build a machine learning model that identifies the best value parlays for daily NBA games using statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

### Project Goals
- Collect and analyze NBA game data
- Build predictive models for game, especially player performance outcomes
- Calculate parlay probabilities and expected value
- Identify high-value betting opportunities

### Development Guidelines
- Use Python for all data processing and modeling
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Maintain clear separation between data collection, analysis, and prediction modules
- Document all major functions and classes
- Use virtual environments for dependency management

### Key Modules
- `data/`: Data collection and preprocessing
- `models/`: Machine learning models and predictions
- `analysis/`: Statistical analysis and backtesting
- `config/`: Configuration and constants
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities
